# floodit
classi game of flood it. I took KolibriOS' version as sample.

In the scripts there is already a default board palette, but if the user want to change the palette, a file named "colors.txt" must be put in the same path of the game.
The txt file must contain 6 lines made of the three RGB values of the wanted colors, each value separeted by a space. I put an example in the projecty.
